Holding down the button to jump multiple layers, I don't like it
Enemiy blocks do not clearly exist on a specific layer
Camera Movment? Paralax w/o Paralax
we can jump around and over, limiting player movment while also creating puzzles is not possible at the moment 
Platforming but obfuscated
right now we can jump around and over problems
Barriers/enemys that exist on all layers "cosmic obsticles"
puzzle solving and platform ing skill
Insert new layers into existence that change the level flow
you stick to celings right now
complete puzzles by alighning imajes or layers?

Rebuild Everything
Humbug
